what are types of identifiers used in gl shaders
	attributes
	constants
	uniforms
	varying - info that is feeding data from vertex shader onto fragment shader

points that dont move - uniforms

					vertex shader can use		fragment shader can use		host access
const								X												X										O
uniform							X												X										X
varying							X* (output)							X* (input)					O
attribute						X												O										X

5)
	part a: scene has same projection and view matrix, but different model matrix
		OR if you wanted to create a range image where the color depends on how far away from the camera
		an object is

ROBOTIC ARM EXAMPLE WILL BE ON EXAM!!! -- transformation stack
HIERARCHICAL MODELING WILL BE ON EXAM!!! -- table example
	-- I can use canvas-like transforms (so know those...)

Z-buffer Algorithm

clear all pixels to "farthest value" (-inf)

for each triangle
  for each pixel
    if new Z > old Z // in front
      write new color and Z

Vertex Attributes - interface with these in programming language
  Location (x,y,z)
  Color (r,g,b)
  Normal (n_x, n_y, n_z)
  Temperature T
  Density

Vertex Uniforms - identifiers
  T_camera
  T_projection
  time
  light

Const
  PI

Varying - used to communicate info from vertex processor to (fragment - pixels that result from rasterization) pixel processor
